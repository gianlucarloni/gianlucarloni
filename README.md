## 💼 Career Highlights

### **Applied Research Scientist at Lunit Inc. :large_blue_circle: :large_blue_circle:**  
*Nov 2024 - Present*  
**Berlin, Germany**

In the Model-Centric AI research team of the Oncology group, I have been:
- :x_ray: Developing AI models to advance the suit of Lunit´s products and the SOTA in medical image analysis.
- :computer: Contributing to the internal research codebases with high-quality code and development standards.
- :handshake: Collaborating with research engineers and medical doctors for practical medical applications.
- :newspaper: Pushing Lunit's technological advancement and publishing in top-tier journals and conferences

### **Research Fellow and PhD Student at National Research Council of Italy**  
*Sep 2021 - Oct 2024*  
**Pisa, Italy**

In the Signals and Images Laboratory, I have:
- :arrow_double_up: Proposed bias-mitigation frameworks for robust DL image classification in out-of-distribution settings under domain shift. Based on causal inference, feature disentanglement, contrastive learning, and injection of prior knowledge. Applied to large RWD CXR datasets.  
- :mag: Investigated techniques to discover causal disposition signals in images via Attention-inspired CNNs for cancer prediction from medical imaging (prostate MRI and HE digital pathology).
- :brain: Proposed biologically inspired context-aware image classifiers akin to human vision.
- :robot: Experienced with DDPMs (generative AI) to synthesize MRI images of prostate cancer.
- :books: Led a systematic literature review to study the intersection of causality and Explainable AI.
- :breast_feeding: Explored the applicability of prototypical part learning in medical imaging by experimenting with ProtoPNet on a breast mass classification from mammogram images.

### **Visiting researcher at The University of Edinburgh**
*Apr - Jun 2023*  
**Edinburgh, UK**

At the VIOS Collaboratory led by Prof. Tsaftaris, I have:
- :telescope: Experimented with representation learning, causal reasoning in neural networks, and diffusion models.
- :left_right_arrow: Collaborated in international research groups
- :desktop_computer: Group-coded with four other PhD students for a MICCAI 2023 challenge.
